 AB_control_events.1.t:0 "Iron Fist Control"
 AB_control_events.1.desc:0 "Your ruler's popularity and control of the nation is absolute. Openly, all work tirelessly to help the state. But in the dark, ambitious rivals scheme to topple this so called golden age... The higher your ruler's popularity is, the higher the benefits for the state are. But the risks of a Power Struggle chain of events increase."
 AB_control_events.1.a:0 "With ultimate power comes... well, problems."
 AB_control_events.2.t:0 "Controlling the Situation"
 AB_control_events.2.desc:0 "Your ruler's popularity and control of the state is acceptable. Most people work well enough in their posts, and tasks are getting done. Rivals aren't deterred though and look to bring chaos, or replace the leadership. The higher your ruler's popularity is, the higher the benefits for the state are. But the risks of a Power Struggle chain of events increase."
 AB_control_events.2.a:0 "Probably a good enough balance of power."
 AB_control_events.3.t:0 "Losing Control"
 AB_control_events.3.desc:0 "Your ruler's popularity and control of the state isn't really good. Corruption and resistance are found in most layers of the society. The silver lining is that rivals aren't really trying to take the rulership, since the ruler isn't threatening anymore. The higher your ruler's popularity is, the higher the benefits for the state are. But the risks of a Power Struggle chain of events increase."
 AB_control_events.3.a:0 "I am not the law anymore."
 AB_control_events.4.t:0 "Total Collapse"
 AB_control_events.4.desc:0 "Your ruler's popularity and control of the state is abysmal. Nobody of value listens to your orders and revolt is everywhere, if not outright civil war. The silver lining is that rivals are too busy plotting against each other to care about a failed ruler. The higher your ruler's popularity is, the higher the benefits for the state are. But the risks of a Power Struggle chain of events increase."
 AB_control_events.4.a:0 "We can only go up from there."
 AB_control_events.5.t:0 "Backstabbing the Backstabber"
 AB_control_events.5.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been informed of yet another plot against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rule. This one isn't the most deadly as it's only, for now atleast, spreading nasty rumors but an opportunity has arisen. The incriminated rival has made a rare rookie mistake which can be turned to our advantage. It could be a way to dispose of an annoying rival. Of course, everyone will suspect our brave ruler of having done the deed anyway..."
 AB_control_events.5.a:0 "One less threat to my establishment."
 AB_control_events.5.b:0 "Counter the plot, but let the rival lives."
 AB_control_events.6.t:0 "Assumed Ambition"
 AB_control_events.6.desc:0 "Recently, a member of your court has made clear his ambition. Already, a considerable part of the court and populace rally behind their cause, and this ambitious one now wants your formal approval for even more. Endorsing this would mean renforcing a potential pretendant in the future, but stopping this right now would be an informal declaration of rivalry, if not more, between you two."
 AB_control_events.6.a:0 "One more rival won't change much..."
 AB_control_events.6.b:0 "I will deal with this pretender when the time comes."
 AB_control_events.7.t:0 "An Helping Hand"
 AB_control_events.7.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has recently received the help of an ambitious politician of the state. Together, they helped stabilize some local crisis before it got out of hand. But now, this newfound "friend" is taking all the credit and uses his fame to elevate himself at your ruler's level. You could stop this scheme, but discrediting him would probably undo all the hard work done until today."
 AB_control_events.7.a:0 "The realm goes first."
 AB_control_events.7.b:0 "I go first."
 AB_control_events.8.t:0 "Shady Partnership" 
 AB_control_events.8.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has received an offer of "mutual benefit" from a fellow compatriot. It makes no doubt that this is too good to be true and is reeking of corruption. Refusing would mean angering your potential partner though."
 AB_control_events.8.a:0 "I serve the state, not myself."
 AB_control_events.8.b:0 "New friend and benefits? Count me in."
 AB_control_events.9.t:0 "Mending the Gap" 
 AB_control_events.9.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has the rare opportunity to make amends for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] past conduct towards a rival. Of course, this would appear as a show of weakness and could be more trouble than it is worth."
 AB_control_events.9.a:0 "Humility can be useful."
 AB_control_events.9.b:0 "I remember my grudges."
